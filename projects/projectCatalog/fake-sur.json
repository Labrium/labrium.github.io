    "description": "A macOS Big Sur operating system replica made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project has been meticulously designed to look virtually indistinguishable from the real OS, and function in a similar way. Other potential fakeOS concepts include fakeOS Fake Sierra (macOS High Sierra 10.13), and fakeOS Fakeetah [name needs work] (OSX Cheetah 10.0).",
